# wordy

Wordy is my first app project written by flutter.
It is used to memorize English vocabularies for chinese users.

This is client custom vocabularies page. Client can record a new word in daily life.

(the backend is SQLite)

This is the detailed vocabulary page. It has "word", "part of speech", "translation", "definition", and at most 5 examples showing how to use the word.

This is the built-in vocabularies page. I will add more words with versioning.

## the development status now
- The home page isn't implemented. I think home page can just put a random word picked from built-in vocabularies or client vocabularies.
- ~~Haven't separate the database now, just for now.~~ Have done it.
- Haven't implemented the "add word" page.
- the UI need improvement.
